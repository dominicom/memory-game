## About the project
This is #3 student project made for Udacity classroom on Front-End Web Developer track.

#### Starter Project
> link https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. It needs to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file - `js/app.js` to start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


#### External libraries Used

* jQuery
* Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976
