#### Starter Project

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. It needs to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file - `js/app.js` to start building out the app's functionality.
